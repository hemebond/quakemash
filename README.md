# Quake Mash

A singular map made of of all the original Quake levels, allowing for a single contiguous play-through.

## Installation ##

Extract `quakemash.bsp` into the `/id1/maps/` directory (create if necessary) in your Quake directory.

## Engines ##

* The latest [DarkPlaces engine](http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/darkplacesengineautobuild.zip)
* The latest version of FTEQW has been tested. Make sure to type `sv_bigcoords 1` to set FTEQW to render the level properly. For audio issues (like echoes) try to change the audio source in the audio options menu.
* [Version r7 of QuakeSpasm](http://triptohell.info/moodles/qss/quakespasm-spike-r7.zip) should also work. Set `sv_protocol 999` to force QuakeSpasm to render the level properly.
